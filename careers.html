                        Fortes Consulting is looking to add two sharp and enthusiastic individuals to their team on an independent-contract basis.
                        We are starting to assemble a team, and about to embark on building a prototype/MVP for our product geared towards career and academic pursuits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We love to work with people who are not only skilled, but love to explore new things, think innovative ideas, and are easy and fun. We will provide you with the autonomy and latitude, and expect you to provide us with the best of solutions. We also believe that everyone on the team is equal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plus, as our name indicates, we love bold thinkers and bolder doers!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Product Designer</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Skills:</b>
                        <br />- 5+ years experience in creating interactive products, preferably for tablets and web
                        <br />- Experience in creating branding and style tiles to align with the product vision, intended user experience, and product road map
                        <br />- Ability to create minimalistic, yet functional interactive products, with a great emphasis on user experience, touch points, and ease of use.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Junior Front-End Developer</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>Skills:</b>
                        <br />- 1-2 years experience in creating interactive web sites, preferably for tablets and web
                        <br />- A thorough understanding and experience in HTML/CSS/JQuery/Javascript, and other Web 2.0 concepts
                        <br />- Experience in working with and modifying Bootstrap framework highly preferred
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Person</h3>
                    <p>
                        - Ability to come up with and share innovative ideas with the team
                        <br />- Proactive about solving problems, rather than just work under given boundaries
                        <br />- Ability to collaborate via email/phone calls and tools like Trello
                        <br />- Great communication skills and friendly attitude
                        <br />- Great team player, since the team will be highly distributed

                        <br />These are ideal as a part-time/side gig, and we understand the constraints. Given this, it might involve interactions outside of typical working hours, but we are very flexible. You will be an independent contractor.
